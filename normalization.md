# Airbnb Clone Database Normalization Report

## ‚úÖ 3NF Verification Summary

The schema was analyzed and found to meet all requirements for Third Normal Form (3NF):

### 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
- All attributes are atomic.
- Each table has a primary key.

### 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
- No partial dependencies exist (each table has a single-column primary key).

### 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
- No transitive dependencies were found.
- All non-key attributes depend only on the primary key of their table.

## üîç Notes on Specific Tables

### User
- No changes needed; already in 3NF.

### Property
- Fully normalized; attributes like `location` and `host_id` are appropriate.

### Booking
- `total_price` may be considered derived; retain only if necessary for audit/history.

### Payment
- Normalized; consider extracting `payment_method` as a lookup table if enums change often.

### Review
- Fully normalized.

### Message
- Fully normalized; sender and recipient correctly reference `User`.

## ‚úÖ Final Status
The schema is well-designed and satisfies 3NF without requiring structural changes.

## üîÑ Optional Enhancements
- Convert enums like `role`, `status`, `payment_method` to lookup/reference tables for better extensibility.
